[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/kleijnweb/jwt-bundle/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/kleijnweb/jwt-bundle)

Integrate JWT API tokens for authentication.

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/kleijnweb/jwt-bundle/releases) to find details about the latest release.

For an example see [swagger-bundle-example](https://github.com/kleijnweb/swagger-bundle-example).

*NOTE:* Looking for PHP <7.0 and Symfony <2.8.7 support? Use a 0.x version.   

## Install

Install using composer (`composer require kleijnweb/jwt-bundle`). You want to check out the [release page](https://github.com/kleijnweb/jwt-bundle/releases) to ensure you are getting what you want and optionally verify your download.

## Authentication

The token is validated using standard (reserved) JWT claims:

| Name  | Type | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `exp` | int [1] | Expiration time must be omitted [3] or be smaller than `time() + leeway` [2]. |
| `nbf` | int [1] | "Not before", token validity start time, must be omitted [3] or greater than or equal to `time() - leeway` [2]. |
| `iat` | int [1] | The time the token was issued, must be omitted [3] or smaller than configured `minIssueTime + leeway`. Required when `minIssueTime` configured.  |
| `iss` | string | Issuer of the token, must match configured `issuer`. Required when `issuer` configured. |
| `aud` | string | JWT "audience", must be omitted [3] or match configured `audience` if configured. Required when `audience` configured. |
| `sub` | string | JWT "subject". Used as `username` for Symfony Security integration. Always required (or its alias), without it the "Resource Owner cannot be identified. |
| `prn` | string | JWT "principle". Deprecated alias for `sub`, used in older versions of the JWT RFC. |
| `jti` | string | JWT "ID". Not used, will be ignored. |
| `typ` | string | Not used, will be ignored. |
 
 - [1] Unix time
 - [2] The `leeway` allows a difference in seconds between the issuer of the token and the server running your app with JwtBundle. Keep at a low number, defaults to 0.
 - [3] Mark any claim required, including custom (non-reserved) ones, using the `require` configuration option.
 
All other claims encountered are ignored. The JWT header is checked for `kid` (see below) and `alg`, which must match the `type` value of the key configuration.

### Keys

The authenticator supports multiple keys, and allows all options to be configured per `kid` (key ID, which must be included in the JWT header when more than 1 key is configured):

```yml
jwt: 
   keys:
      keyOne: # Only one key, 'kid' is optional (but must match when provided)
        issuer: http://api.server.com/oauth2/token # OAuth2 example, but could be any string value
        audience: ~ # NULL, accept any
        minIssueTime: 1442132949 # Reject 'old' tokens, regardless of 'exp'
        require: [nbf, exp, my-claim] # Mark claims as required
        leeway: 5 # Allow 5 seconds of time de-synchronization (both ways) between this server and api.server.com
```
JwtBundle and the issuer must share a secret in order for JwtBundle to be able to verify tokens. You can choose between a *pre shared key* (PSK) or *asymmetric keys*. 

```yml
jwt:
   keys:
      keyOne: # Must match 'kid'
        issuer: http://api.server1.com/oauth2/token
        secret: 'A Pre-Shared Key'
        # type:  Defaults to HS256 (HMACSHA256). All options: HS256, HS512, RS256 and RS512
      keyTwo: # Must match 'kid'
        issuer: http://api.server2.com/oauth2/token
        type: RS256 # RSA SHA256, needed for asymmetric keys
        secret: |
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAwND1VMVJ3BC/aM38tQRH
                2GDHecXE8EsGoeAeBR5dFt3QC1/Eoub/F2kee3RBtI6I+kDBjrSDz5lsqh3Sm7N/
                47fTKZLvdBaHbCuYXVBQ2tZeEiUBESnsY2HUzXDlqSyDWohuiYeeL6gewxe1CnSE
                0l8gYZ0Tx4ViPFYulva6siew0f4tBuSEwSPiKZQnGcssQYJ/VevTD6L4wGoDhkXV
                VvJ+qiNgmXXssgCl5vHs22y/RIgeOnDhkj81aB9Evx9iR7DOtyRBxnovrbN5gDwX
                m6IDw3fRhZQrVwZ816/eN+1sqpIMZF4oo4kRA4b64U04ex67A/6BwDDQ3LH0mD4d
                EwIDAQAB
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    
```

To use *asymmetric keys*, `type` MUST be set to `RS256` or `RS512`. The secret in this case is the public key of the issuer.

### Loading Secrets From An External Source

Instead of configuring secrets statically, they can also be loaded dynamically, using any data available in the JWT token. Example configuration:

```yml
jwt:
   keys:
    keyThree: # Must match 'kid'
      issuer: http://api.server1.com/oauth2/token
      loader: 'my.loader.di.key'
    
```

The loader must implement `KleijnWeb\JwtBundle\Authenticator\SecretLoader`. A simple example that loads the secret from an ambiguous data store:

```php
use KleijnWeb\JwtBundle\Authenticator\JwtToken;
use KleijnWeb\JwtBundle\Authenticator\SecretLoader;

class SimpleSecretLoader implements SecretLoader
{
    /**
     * @var DataStore
     */
    private $store;

    /**
     * @param DataStore $store
     */
    public function __construct(DataStore $store)
    {
        $this->store = $store;
    }

    /**
     * @param JwtToken $token
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function load(JwtToken $token)
    {
        return $this->store->loadSecretByUsername($token->getClaims()['sub']);
    }
}
```

You could use any information available in the token, such as the `kid`, `alg` or any custom claims. You cannot configure both `secret` and `loader`. Be sure to throw an `AuthenticationException` when appropriate (eg missing claims needed for loading secret).

### Integration Into Symfony Security

Synopsis:

```yml
security:
  firewalls:
    default:
      stateless: true
      jwt:
        header: X-Header-Name # Defaults to "Authorization", in which case encountered "Bearer" prefixes are stripped
        provider: jwt

  providers:
    jwt:
      id: jwt.user_provider
```

Using the bundled user provider is optional. This will produce user objects from the token data alone with roles produced from the `aud` claim (and `IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY` whether `aud` was set or not).

### Assigning audience to user roles using an alternate UserProvider

JwtBundle can assign the audience claims in the JwtToken to the User objects user roles properties. Ideally, this is done in the UserProvider, so that the groups cannot be modified.

If this is an acceptable risk, you do not want to use JwtUser/JwtUserProvider, but *do* want JwtBundle to copy `aud` claims to user roles, you can have your User class implement the `KleijnWeb\JwtBundle\User\UnsafeGroupsUserInterface` interface, and JwtBundle will add the roles *after* the user is loaded from the provider.
This behavior may be removed in future versions.

_NOTE:_ This function *only* copies the the roles from the token.

### Issuing Token

Issuing tokens is currently limited to `HS256`. To create a token string:

```php
$token = new JwtToken([
    'header' => [
        'alg' => 'HS256',
        'typ' => 'JWT',
        'kid' => 'Optional Key ID'
    ],
    'claims' => [ /*  Array of claims */ ],
    'secret' => 'Your Secret'
]);

$token->getTokenString();
```
